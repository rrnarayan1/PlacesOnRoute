# PlacesOnRoute
A Web app that routes user from their current location to the ClickTime office, and routes them through a coffee and donut shop.


### Additional Features:
* Routes user through a cafe that is on the way. This is defined as being 3000 meters off from the route. It also prioritizes stopping at a cafe closer to the source, rather than the destination.
* Makes sure that the cafe that it routes to is open currently. That is, it will not route user to a cafe that is closed.
* Gives the user 2 choices in terms of places they could stop at
* View the map rendering of the directions, as well as step-by-step directions
* Support for all modes of transportation, including public transportation.
